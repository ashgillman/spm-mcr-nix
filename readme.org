#+title: Unofficial: Statistical Parametric Mapping with MATLAB Compiler Runtime on Nix

This repository contains a [[https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake.html#description][Nix Flake]] for building [[https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/][Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)]] on the [[https://au.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html][Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR)]].

* What works?
- Batched commands, like =spm12 batch /path/to/jobfile.m=.
  - Tested:
    - ~spm.spatial.coreg.estimate~

* What doesn't work?
- Anything requiring GUI.
  - Cause seems to be that Java hasn't been linked properly.
- Probably everything else.

* Versions
Currently supports:
- MCR version :: R2019b (9.7.9)
- SPM version :: 12 (7771)

* Other projects
